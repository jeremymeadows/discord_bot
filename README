Old Tom is a discord bot for my GW2 fractal guild named after the golem boss in
Uncategorized.

He has different modules which help manage the guild and scheduling between
players. More info can be read in the `help` function of each module.

**Note**: this bot is only intended to be in one discord server at the moment,
as there is no segregation in the databases and data can leak between servers
